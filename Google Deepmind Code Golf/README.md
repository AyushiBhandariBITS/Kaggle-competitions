In this competition, you will be presented with all 400 tasks from the public training set (v1) and challenged to produce a Python 3 program for each that exhibits the desired behavior. Not only must these programs be functionally correct, but (as an added twist) should also be as minimal as possible. A set of concise source codes emphasizing robustness and simplicity could potentially serve as canonical reference solutions for this seminal dataset, and — once open-sourced to the broader research community — might contribute toward the development of more versatile AI systems.
